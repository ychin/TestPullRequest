# Comparisons

Below are comparisons of the 4 main Git repository hosts (Visual Studio Online, Gitlab, Github, Bitbucket) and see how they compare in different use cases and what functionalities they provide.

## Record pushes

VSTS: Explicit feature

Gitlab: Sort of hidden under "Activities"

Github / Bitbucket: None

## Search by author in commits

VSTS: Yes

Gitlab: No

Github: No

Bitbucket: No

## Comparing revisions

VSTS: Each file has a "History" and "Compare" tab to compare different revisions. History allows filtering by author/etc just like regular commits browsing. Neat.

GitLab: Each file only "history". *But* it has a generic "Compare" page to compare any arbitrary commits so if you can still get file revision diffs, just more work and have to filter thorugh the diff for your file.

Bitbucket: Nice per-file history that allows arbitrary commit diffing of the file.

Github: Only per-file historyâ€¦ Edit: Apparently you can use "/compare" in the URL and get a compare functionality between commits. It's just not exposed anywhere in the UI.

## Pull request - recognizing pushes

VSTS:
  - Individual pushes are well organized as "updates".
  - Can see each update's change compared to previous one.
      - Smart enough to not show unrelated added files that got added in master commit and put pulled in via rebase.
      - *Cannot* diff different arbitrary updates against each other.
  - File organization via left sidebar. Clearer to navigate.
  - Under each file you can also go to compare individial revisions like regular file browsing so you can group together a list of commits and see their aggregate diff, which Gitlab can't do.

Gitlab:
  - Recognizes updates, and show in activities, but not organized separately like VSTS.
  - Can see each update's changes and can even diff arbitrary different updates against each other.
      - Added unrelated files *will* show up when comparing different updates which sucks.
  - File organization is through unified list with a search box which I find more cluttered and harder to use in large PR.

Bitbucket: Sort of upderstands pushes, but not really.

Github: Doesn't make updates explicit.
  - Does provide ability to see a file's diffs with a selected range of commits (not updates).

*Wish*: Gitlab is arguably the best, but even so, I still wish there is a "diff the diff" optino to simply see if a rebase operation has actually changed anything to the actual commit change.

## Looking at merge commits

This is one way to accomplishing "diff the diffs". If you make a merge out of the old commits vs the new upstream *instead* of doing a rebase, Git can show you how much it thinks has changed. Unfortunately this is not perfect, see "merge-feature-1b" branch where Git still doesn't know how to show it properly.

Native Git command:
  - `git show` / `git show --cc` or `git show -c`
  - This seems to still show some random stuff even though it's a clean merge / rebase operation meaning there should be nothing showing.

VSTS
  - Allows diffing merge commit against either parent, good.
  - Still show extra information in the diffs. It should show *nothing* since it's a clean diff meaning I haven't made any changes other than pulling upstream.
  - In some cases like merge-feature-1 (generated by merging original changes against changes rebased with upstream) it does show empty which is good. Also this is what "git show --cc" shows as well.

Github / Bitbucket / Gitlab
  - Don't let you pick parents at all.

Pretty weak except for VSTS. Still, it shows `git show --cc` is not perfect, and you will still have to siff through extra data just to see if anything has changed between rebases/merges. Interdiff still seems like the best choice for that.

## Pull request - commenting system

VSTS
  - Leave comments and can resolve/close/won't fix.
  - Front page sees all issues, and each file will show you as well. Clean and neat.
  - Markdown.

Gitlab
  - Can comment and leave open discussions that need to be resolved. UI doesn't give filtering capabilities though so could be hard to find in dozens of discussions.
  - Markdown.

Github
  - Actually decent. You need to officially "start a review", and leave comments on different parts. Then you can approve the review or send back for rework.
  - The UI also remembers your last reviewed location and can show you only updated code since then, similar to how Code Collab works which is pretty useful for large / long reviews. Also this provides a centralized place to see yay or nay on a PR.
  - Markdown.

Bitbucket
  - Just comments, and can make "tasks" which is ok, not great.
  - Also comments are not in Markdown.

Github is actually quite good on this, especially with the explicit review state and the ability to remember your last reviewed commit so as to only show you need diffs next time.

## Search within files

Github: Search works

Gitlab: Search works (filename or content both fine)

Bitbucket: No

VSTS: Surprisingly, no.

# General thoughts

Surprised how Github is actually kind of not that feature-rich and not that much better than Bitbucket.

Gitlab comes out looking good with some neat features. In general I actually still prefer **VSTS** which is a lot more feature-rich.
